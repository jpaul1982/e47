=== E47 Lean Boilerplate ===

 - Enqueue front-end assets in inc/theme_scripts.php
 - Build header markup (including nav and logo) in header.php
 - Build footer markup in footer.php
 - No page builders!
 - Use Advanced Custom Fields Pro!
 - Write your CSS and any necessary JS.
 -- Bonus points if you use SCSS and your choice of pre-processor to compile from /src/scss to assets/css!
 --- There's a Gulpfile in the theme root; if that suits your vibe, run npm install, then gulp dev to watch and compile.
